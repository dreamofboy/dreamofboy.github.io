Distinguished Names (DN) are used in PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).  
The DN is the combination of one or more RDNs (Relative Distinguished Name).  
This is specified in the [X.509 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509).  
This is [RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt).
